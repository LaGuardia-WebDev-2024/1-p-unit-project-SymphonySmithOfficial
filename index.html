        <h2>While there are so many great and cool people in the world, one stands above the rest: Symphony!! Here's why:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Symphony is very kind🤗</li>
            <ul>                <li>Kind people are really great! Since Symphony is kind, and kind people are great, wouldn't that mean Symphony is great?🤔
