        <h2>While there are so many great and cool people in the world, one stands above the rest: Symphony!! Here's why:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Symphony is very kind🤗</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Kind people are really great! Since Symphony is kind, and kind people are great, wouldn't that mean Symphony is great?🤔

                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Symphony is really smart🤓</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Smart people have oppurtunities to do smart people things, like sing at the UN Headquarters! Have <strong>you</strong> sung at the UN Headquarters??? Didn't think so 🥱</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Symphony has a lot of friends👭👩🏿‍🤝‍👩🏿👩🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏻👩🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏾</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Do people who aren't great have a lot of friends? Maybe...But do they have <em>good</em> friends who are gospel director and sing at the UN Headquarters?? NUHUHHHHH🙅🏽‍♀️🙅🏽‍♀️</li>
